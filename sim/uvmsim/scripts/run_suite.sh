# ---- BUDGET POLICY (raised 2026-08-13) --------------------------------------
# Every TIMEOUT below is >=3x the MEASURED cycle count at 2CL (the slower of our
# two configs). Rationale, learned the hard way twice:
#   * TIMEOUT is a FAILSAFE CAP, not a run length. A passing test exits on
#     program completion (busy deassertion, OBS-024) long before the cap, so
#     raising a budget costs nothing unless a test genuinely hangs. There is no
#     trade-off to tune here - an under-set budget is pure downside.
#   * A timeout is staged as a FAILURE (`stage $?` stages only passing runs), so
#     it silently drops the run from the coverage bank AND masks whatever is
#     underneath it. In the 2026-08-12 2CL suite, barrier_sync_test timed out at
#     149,999/150,000 and riscv_rand_instr_test at 199,999/200,000 - both within
#     a rounding error of their cap - and each was hiding a real divergence
#     (OBS-026, OBS-027) that only surfaced once the budget was raised.
# When adding a test: measure it at the SLOWEST config you support, then set 3x.
# Do not trim a budget toward the measured value to "save time" - it saves none.

# JALR-DERAIL FIX (2026-07-16, INV-4): riscv-dv deliberately generates jalr targets = label+1
# (riscv_directed_instr_lib.sv "JALR is expected to set lsb to 0"). Vortex does NOT clear the
# jalr LSB (OBS-012) -> odd architectural PC -> auipc-derived addresses skewed -> misaligned
# data accesses (all 12 profiles fired the LSU RUNTIME_ASSERT; OBS-013 silent corruption).
# Patched LOCALLY in ~/riscv-dv (offset -> 0, marked "VORTEX LOCAL PATCH (INV-4)"); regen
# (RISCV_DV_REGEN=1, already set) picks it up. Revert the patch if the RTL ever implements & ~1.
# MISALIGNED FIX (2026-07-03): Vortex HW does not support misaligned accesses
# (VX_lsu_slice.sv "memory misalignment not supported!"; halfword byte-enable drops
# addr bit 0; RUNTIME_ASSERT on alignment — confirmed vs upstream master). riscv-dv's
# rv32im target was wrongly set support_unaligned_load_store=1, so it generated
# misaligned accesses -> asserts. Fixed at the source:
# riscv-dv/target/rv32im/riscv_core_setting.sv support_unaligned_load_store=1'b0.
# CORRECTION (2026-07-16, INV-4): riscv_unaligned_load_store_test does NOT become a
# normal aligned test under that setting — its base_testlist gen_opts force
# +enable_unaligned_load_store=1 (7020 LSU asserts even after the jalr fix). Its
# purpose (verify unaligned-data support) is unimplementable on Vortex (OBS-013)
# -> EXCLUDED, same class as riscv_illegal_instr_test.
# NOTE: several RETAINED tests pass on liveness but are UNVERIFIABLE (SimX golden model aborts on
# some random sequences — Steven's SimX-robustness lane); they run the DUT to EBREAK cleanly.
# FW-1b (2026-08-13): riscv_pmp_test REMOVED — it is not a distinct test.
# It generated a program BYTE-IDENTICAL to riscv_non_compressed_instr_test
# (both .S md5 16be14c6ebe6). Both testlist entries delegate to
# `gen_test: riscv_rand_instr_test` and differ only by gen_opts that are INERT
# at --target=rv32im: +disable_compressed_instr=1 is vacuous (rv32im has no C
# extension — measured 0 compressed instructions) and the PMP options produced
# 0 pmpcfg/pmpaddr writes (and prepare.sh seds M-mode CSR writes away anyway).
# So the suite was counting 2 results where there was 1 program, and NEITHER
# tested the feature its name claims. Keeping it inflated the pass count and
# double-counted its 2CL failure as two divergences.
# Verified by md5-ing all 10 generated programs: this is the ONLY duplicate
# pair; the other 8 are distinct. Suite is now 44 DISTINCT programs.
# Do not re-add without making the gen_opts effective on a target that
# implements the feature.
