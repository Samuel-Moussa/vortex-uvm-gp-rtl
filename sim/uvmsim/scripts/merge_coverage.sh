# merge_coverage.sh — merge a CONTROLLED SET of per-test UCDBs into one report.
# Implements plan COV-METH (Part 3.2-3.3).
#
# Contamination fix: the merge consumes ONLY ucdbs staged in cov/staging/,
# NOT every coverage.ucdb under results/. You choose what goes in, so old
# runs / wrong-config runs can't silently pollute the number.
#
#   cov/staging/<test>_<cfg>.ucdb  (you stage these — see --collect / collect_cov.sh)
#                  │  vcover merge
#                  ▼
#       cov/merged_raw.ucdb
#                  │  apply scripts/coverage_exclude.do
#                  ▼
#       cov/merged.ucdb  ──►  HTML + functional + code + summary
#
# Usage:
#   ./merge_coverage.sh                 # merge everything currently in cov/staging/
#   ./merge_coverage.sh --fresh         # CLEAR staging first, then exit (start clean)
#   ./merge_coverage.sh --collect R...  # copy named results/<R>/reports/coverage.ucdb
#                                       #   into staging, then merge
#   ./merge_coverage.sh --list          # show what's currently staged
#
# Typical flow for a clean 4-kernel report:
#   ./merge_coverage.sh --fresh
#   make sim TEST=kernel_launch_test PROGRAM_NAME=vecadd    TIMEOUT=10000000
#   make sim TEST=kernel_launch_test PROGRAM_NAME=conform   TIMEOUT=10000000
#   make sim TEST=kernel_launch_test PROGRAM_NAME=fibonacci TIMEOUT=10000000
#   make sim TEST=kernel_launch_test PROGRAM_NAME=hello     TIMEOUT=10000000
#   # each run auto-stages itself IF you add the collect hook to simulate.sh
#   # (see collect snippet); otherwise stage manually:
#   ./merge_coverage.sh --collect 20260620/run_AAA 20260620/run_BBB ...
#   ./merge_coverage.sh
