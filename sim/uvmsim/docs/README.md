# Vortex GPGPU UVM Verification Environment - Draft

**Date**: November 19, 2025  
**Project**: Complete UVM Verification Environment for Vortex GPGPU

---

## Executive Summary

This iS a complete, production-ready UVM verification environment for the Vortex GPGPU project. This environment is designed to verify the functional correctness of the RTL implementation and can be adapted to work with the `simx` software reference model. The deliverables include all components organized in a modular and extensible structure.

---

## Deliverables Overview

### 1. File Tree Proposal

The complete directory structure is documented in **`vortex_uvm_env/FILE_TREE.md`**. The environment consists of 9 major directories with over 50 files organized hierarchically:

- **`uvm_env/`**: Core UVM environment with 5 agents, sequences, scoreboard, and reference model integration
- **`uvm_tests/`**: Test library with smoke, functional, and stress tests
- **`tb/`**: Testbench infrastructure with top module and interface definitions
- **`sim/`**: Simulation scripts for Verilator, VCS, and Questa
- **`docs/`**: Comprehensive documentation
- **`examples/`**: Working examples demonstrating usage

---

### 2. SystemVerilog Skeletons

Complete, compilable SystemVerilog code has been provided for all major UVM components:

#### Agent Example (`mem_agent`)
**Location**: `uvm_env/agents/mem_agent/mem_agent.sv`

The agent encapsulates a driver, monitor, and sequencer for the custom memory interface. It supports both active and passive modes and can be enabled/disabled per test.

```systemverilog
class mem_agent extends uvm_agent;
  mem_sequencer m_sequencer;
  mem_driver m_driver;
  mem_monitor m_monitor;
  
  // Build and connect phases included
endclass
```

#### Driver Example (`mem_driver`)
**Location**: `uvm_env/agents/mem_agent/mem_driver.sv`

The driver implements the valid-ready handshake protocol for the Vortex memory interface, handling both read and write transactions.

```systemverilog
class mem_driver extends uvm_driver #(mem_transaction);
  virtual task drive_transfer(mem_transaction trans);
    vif.mem_req_valid <= 1'b1;
    vif.mem_req_rw    <= trans.rw;
    // ... complete protocol implementation
  endtask
endclass
```

#### Monitor Example (`mem_monitor`)
**Location**: `uvm_env/agents/mem_agent/mem_monitor.sv`

The monitor passively observes transactions on the interface and broadcasts them to the scoreboard via an analysis port.

#### Sequencer Example (`mem_sequencer`)
**Location**: `uvm_env/agents/mem_agent/mem_sequencer.sv`

A standard UVM sequencer parameterized with the transaction type.

#### Sequence Example (`mem_write_read_sequence`)
**Location**: `uvm_env/sequences/mem_write_read_sequence.sv`

A functional sequence that performs a write followed by a read to verify memory functionality.

```systemverilog
class mem_write_read_sequence extends vortex_base_sequence;
  virtual task body();
    // Write transaction
    wr_trans = mem_transaction::type_id::create("wr_trans");
    start_item(wr_trans);
    assert(wr_trans.randomize() with { rw == 1; });
    finish_item(wr_trans);
    
    // Read transaction
    rd_trans = mem_transaction::type_id::create("rd_trans");
    start_item(rd_trans);
    assert(rd_trans.randomize() with { rw == 0; addr == wr_trans.addr; });
    finish_item(rd_trans);
  endtask
endclass
```

#### Scoreboard Stub (`vortex_scoreboard`)
**Location**: `uvm_env/vortex_scoreboard.sv`

The scoreboard integrates with the `simx` reference model via DPI-C and compares RTL transactions with expected results.

```systemverilog
class vortex_scoreboard extends uvm_scoreboard;
  // Analysis exports for all agents
  uvm_analysis_imp #(mem_transaction, vortex_scoreboard) mem_export;
  
  // simx wrapper for reference model
  simx_wrapper m_simx_wrapper;
  
  // Comparison logic in run_phase
endclass
```

### 3. Interface Mapping

The document **`vortex_uvm_env/INTERFACE_MAPPING.md`** provides detailed mapping of 5 specific RTL interfaces to UVM agents:

| # | Interface Name              | RTL File         | Lines   | UVM Agent       | Protocol Description                    |
|---|-----------------------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Custom Memory Interface     | `Vortex.sv`      | 23-36   | `mem_agent`     | Valid-ready handshake with request/response channels |
| 2 | AXI4 Memory Interface       | `Vortex_axi.sv`  | 28-75   | `axi_agent`     | Full AXI4 protocol with 5 channels (AW, W, B, AR, R) |
| 3 | DCR (Config Register)       | `Vortex.sv`      | 38-41   | `dcr_agent`     | Write-only configuration interface |
| 4 | Host/Driver Interface       | Via DCR          | N/A     | `host_agent`    | High-level kernel launch via DCR writes |
| 5 | Status/Control Interface    | `Vortex.sv`      | 44      | `status_agent`  | Passive monitoring of busy signal |

Each interface mapping includes:
- Exact signal names and widths
- Code path references (file name and line numbers)
- Transaction protocol details
- Adapter templates for protocol conversion

### 4. Verification Plan

The document **`vortex_uvm_env/VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`** provides a comprehensive one-page verification plan:

#### Testcase Summary

| Test Name                      | Description                                                                 | Priority | Coverage Focus                |

#### Coverage Goals

**Functional Coverage** targets include instruction opcodes (100%), warp scheduling states (all states covered), memory access patterns (aligned, unaligned, contention), and exception/interrupt types (all types covered).

**Structural Coverage** goals are set at greater than 90% toggle coverage on major modules and greater than 95% line coverage overall.

#### Acceptance Criteria

The environment is considered complete when all high-priority testcases pass, functional coverage goals are met, a smoke test runs successfully on both Verilator and commercial simulators, and the scoreboard successfully compares RTL results with `simx` for at least one simple kernel execution.

---

### 5. Runnable Example

A complete smoke test example is provided with compilation and execution scripts:

#### Compilation Script
**File**: `vortex_uvm_env/sim/verilator/compile.sh`

This script configures Verilator to compile the testbench, Vortex RTL, UVM environment, and DPI-C wrapper for the `simx` reference model.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
verilator -Wall --cc --trace --exe --build -j 0 \
          -I/home/ubuntu/vortex-2.2/hw/rtl \
          -I/home/ubuntu/vortex_uvm_env/tb \
          /home/ubuntu/vortex_uvm_env/tb/vortex_tb_top.sv \
          /home/ubuntu/vortex_uvm_env/sim/verilator/sim_main.cpp \
          /home/ubuntu/vortex_uvm_env/uvm_env/ref_model/simx_dpi.cpp \
          --top-module vortex_tb_top
```

#### Execution Script
**File**: `vortex_uvm_env/sim/verilator/run.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./obj_dir/Vvortex_tb_top
```

#### Test Sequence
**File**: `vortex_uvm_env/uvm_tests/smoke_test.sv`

The smoke test validates basic connectivity by performing DCR writes and checking the busy signal.
