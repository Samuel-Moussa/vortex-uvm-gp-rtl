// File: vx_cache_probe.sv
// Description: PASSIVE cache-event coverage probe (FW-6 / gap G1).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//   The functional coverage model had NO cache-event coverage at any level. The
//   only cache-adjacent coverpoints (cp_id_route / cross_type_route in the
//   collector) sample memory ROUTING TAG BITS, not cache behaviour. So hit/miss,
//   eviction, writeback, MSHR pressure and flush were observed by nothing —
//   leaving the cache hierarchy, one of the likeliest homes for real bugs,
//   covered only by code coverage plus end-state/lockstep equivalence. A cache
//   with a latent corner-case bug can satisfy both of those.
//   See docs/COVERAGE_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md gap G1.
//
// WHERE IT BINDS
//   Into VX_cache_bank — the bank pipeline, which is where hit/miss is actually
//   resolved. One probe instance per bank per cache, so L1 I$/D$, L2 and L3 each
//   appear as SEPARATE covergroup instances in the UCDB hierarchy (per-config
//   sign-off is unaffected; instances are never blended).
//
// CONFIG-AWARENESS (the important property)
//   This probe is config-aware BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by `ifdef:
//   VX_cache_wrap.sv:160 instantiates VX_cache — and therefore VX_cache_bank —
//   ONLY when `PASSTHRU == 0`. With L2/L3 disabled those levels are pure bypass,
//   no bank exists, so `bind` creates NO instance and contributes NO bins. There
//   is no unreachable 0% block to waive, and no denominator inflation on the
//   default (L2/L3-off) build — the failure mode that made the TCU covergroup a
//   ~195-bin dead block before it was gated (vx_instr_probe.sv).
//   A belt-and-braces `ENABLE` parameter is provided so the bind site can also
//   suppress a level explicitly; it defaults to on.
//
// PASSIVE — NEVER A CHECKER
//   Observability only. Nothing here drives a signal or produces a pass/fail
//   verdict; the only checkers remain the end-state and lockstep comparisons.
